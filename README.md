Diet Problem Solver

Users Manual:
1. On the sidebar panel, a list of foods with checkboxes is displayed for the users to select. Three buttons are available: 'pre-select' to select the first 20 items on the food table, 'reset' to remove selected foods, and 'all' to choose all food items.
   
2. After selecting the foods, a user can now switch to the Results tab panel to view the results of his/her selection. The following will be displayed:
   a. the table of foods that have been selected
   b. the final solution for the nutrients and servings of foods
   c. the optimal cost for his/her optimal diet per day
   d. the breakdown of cost and servings of foods for his/her optimal diet
   Note: the Result tab panel displays an error if there is at most one food being selected, thus the user must select more than 1 food items

3. To be able to view the tableaus generated for each iteration, a user can switch to the Tableau tab panel. It displays the list of tableaus (including the initial tableau, tableau[0]), and the basic solutions extracted from each tableau.
